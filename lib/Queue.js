/**
 * Queue
 * -----------------------------
 * A Queue data structure
 *
 * A queue is a data structure in which the first element is inserted from one end called
 * REAR (also called tail), and the deletion of existing element takes place from the other
 * end called as FRONT (also called head).  This makes queue a FIFO (first in first out), or
 * the element that is inserted first will always be the first to be removed.
 * You will be using an Object as an internal datastore.  Do not use an Array!
 *
 * There should be a constructor method with no arguments.
 *
 * Note that the _storage Object is OPTIONAL as there is a way to implement this exercise
 * without the _storage Object.
 *
 * @private {object} _storage              Default value should be an empty object.
 * @private {number} _start                Default value should be set to 0.
 * @private {number} _end                Default value should be set to 0.
 *
